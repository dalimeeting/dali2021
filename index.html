  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Important announcement: No DALI in 2020, postponed to October 2021</h4>
  <p>
  Dear DALI participants!
  </p>
  <p>
  As DALI attendees, your safety is our top priority, and we have been monitoring the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) situation very carefully.
  The potential difficulties around travel, as well as considerations of general public health and safety, have led us to decide to take precautions and postpone the event to <strong>October 28-31, 2021</strong>, meaning that <strong>there will be no DALI in 2020</strong>.
  The <a href="{{ '/venue' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">venue</a> will, however, remain the same for 2021.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  Regarding potential reimbursements for the April 2020 dates, we will soon be contacting you individually about these.
  In any case, you can always <a href="mailto:drebmann@google.com">reach out to Diana Rebmann.</a> 
  We thank you for your understanding and are happy to answer any questions you may have.
  </p>
