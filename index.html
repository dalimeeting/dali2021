<p>The idea of DALI (Data, Learning and Inference) is to combine the special qualities of the former Snowbird meetings (intimate atmosphere, very good people, plenty of time to interact) with attractive aspects of larger conferences that rarely take place in Europe. 
We use a three-day format with two days of workshops and one day of plenary talks in the middle, including a poster session. 
We pick a location that limits jet lag and / or travel times for many of us who normally travel to meetings in the US. 
The workshops feature research topics of current interest, and workshop participants are nominated by the workshop organizers. 
DALI is small and (geographically) biased towards European researchers. 
Participation is by invitation only.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Important announcement: DALI 2020 postponed to October</h4>
  <p>
  Dear DALI participants,
  </p>
  <p>
  As DALI attendees, your safety is our top priority, and we have been monitoring the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) situation very carefully.
  The potential difficulties around travel (with many of you already informing us that they are not allowed to travel at the moment), as well as considerations of general public health and safety, have led us to <strong>decide to take precautions and postpone the event to October 28-31, 2020</strong>. 
  The <a href="{{ '/venue' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">venue</a> will remain the same. 
  </p>
  <p>
  We are aware that this timing may not be suitable for some of you and apologize for any inconvenience this might cause.
  We negotiated with the conference hotel that we will be able to simply transfer your registration and hotel booking to the October dates. 
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  Regarding potential reimbursements, we will soon be contacting you individually about these.
  In any case, you can always <a href="mailto:drebmann@google.com">reach out to Diana Rebmann.</a> 
  We thank you for your understanding and are happy to answer any questions you may have.
  </p>
