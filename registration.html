  You will also be able to reserve a hotel room at the conference venue during the registration process.	
  If you rather want to book your accommodation separately at a later point in time, you can <a href="https://www.eventosycongresosweb.com/pub/1900011/q2/cgi.hrb?idexp=L0YUZ&main=alojamiento">do that here</a>.	
</p>	
<p>	
  In case you book your accommodation <em>before</em> you register for the conference, you will later only have to fill in the personal area in order to select the registration fee.	
  It is not necessary to fill out the registration form again (that way your profile would be duplicated).
